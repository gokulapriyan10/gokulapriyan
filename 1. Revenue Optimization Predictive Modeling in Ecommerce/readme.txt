1. predictive_modeling_code_with_analysis.pynb -> contains complete project code
2. trained_model.pkl                           -> pickle file was used to store the trained data so that we can run the code anytime using deployment code
3. deployment.py                               -> deployment was done using streamlit [command to run deployment: streamlit run deployment.py]
